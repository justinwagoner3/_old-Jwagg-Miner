=== Active
 * Add "hover" over the next rock to mine
 * Add GUI for user to choose what rock they want to mine
 * add `time ran` to gui
 * revamp gui with art
 * hop world incrementally instead of randomly


=== Consider
 * ~~want to sometimes try to mine an ore even with a full inventory
  * could implement part of the time leaving the skills tab open, and this would be when you try mining with full inv


=== Completed
 * ~~Add checking of skills randomly
 * ~~Add world hopping after someone occupies space for longer than certain amount of time
 * ~~Add random sleeps
  * ~~Think to have sleeping as a task, and its execution is based off random number generation and happens 5-10%
    ~~of the time
 * ~~add current level and levels gained to gui
 * ~~skills tabs gets left open sometimes
 * ~~decrease area to hop world
